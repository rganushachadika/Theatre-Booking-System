# Theatre Seat Management System

Welcome to the repository for the Theatre Seat Management System, developed as part of the Software Development II coursework at the University of Westminster. This system is designed to manage and control the seats for theatre sessions, providing an intuitive way to handle seat bookings, cancellations, and viewings.

## Features

- **Seat Booking**: Securely book seats for any available show with ease.
- **Real-time Seating Updates**: See which seats are taken and available in real-time.
- **Seat Cancellation**: Cancel booked seats as needed.
- **Seat Availability Listing**: Check available seats across all rows.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load seating data from a file for later use.
- **Ticket Sorting**: View and sort tickets by price.
- **User Management**: Add personal details associated with each ticket for better management.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rganushachadika/Theatre.git

```bash
cd your Theatre
```

## Usage

Run the application using your preferred IDE that supports Java (IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc.). The main entry point is the `Theatre.java` file.

## Development

This system is implemented in Java and makes use of object-oriented programming concepts to maintain a clean and modular codebase. The project adheres to the coursework specifications provided by Dr. Ester Bonmati.
